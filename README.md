## License
Haulers is free and open-source software, and will stay that way forever. Each part of this project contains licensing information in files named `README.md` - make sure you read them! The below table also documents which sections are under what license, though you should still read the licensing section of each README.

You can click on the license name to open a copy, or if viewing this document as plain text, go to the bottom of the page to find links.
